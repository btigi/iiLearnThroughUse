+) Section 1. About
===================
  The Learn Through Use Mod attempts to add a small element of realism to the game. Rather than offering weapon proficiency points for weapon types the player may never have even seen, let alone used, Learn Through Use weapon proficiencies for weapon types the player is actually using.
It makes sense - the more you hits an opponent with a weapon, the better you get at doing it! Each weapon type is handled individually (e.g. daggers and katana's are handled separately, as in the original game) and all items retain their assigned weapon proficiencies (e.g. The Flail of Ages still uses the Flail proficiency).

A proficiency point is awarded after a certain number of successful strikes on an opponent. The Learn Through Use Mod allows the player to choose the amount of weapon usage required for each proficiency point gained, and for each stage of proficiency, e.g. the first proficiency point could be gained for 10 successful strikes, the second could be gained for 20 successful strikes, the third for 40 successful strikes, the fourth for 80 and the fifth for 500.

The Learn Through Use Mod should affect all weapons that are installed in the game at the time the mod is installed, i.e. it should be installed late in the install process.

Note: If installed into a current game, existing weapon proficiencies of characters will not be altered initially, however proficiencies may drop down to match the new system over time.

+) Section 3. Known Issues
==========================
Characters cease their current action after gaining a weapon proficiency (e.g. if, while attacking an enemy, you gain a weapon proficiency, you will stop attacking the enemy - you'll just stand there!).
